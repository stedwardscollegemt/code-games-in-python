# Chapter 1 Getting Started

## What is Python?

We need to feed computer systems <b>algorithms</b> to perform different tasks. An algorithm is a <b>list of step-by-step instructions</b> which can be written in a <b>programming language</b>. 

Python is one of the most popular programming languages because:

- it is easy to understand;
- many different computers can run Python code;
- you can build many different applications; and,
- you can get a lot of help to make coding simpler as you learn.

## What does code in Python look like?

Python is a <b>text-based programming language</b> and it has a <b>syntax</b> that is made up of <b>words and symbols</b>. Like in any other programming language there are strict rules that need to be followed which you will pick up by practicing. 

What do you think this code snippet does?

```
if a == 2:
    print("Hi there!")
else:
    print("Bye bye then. See you later!")
```

## How will we learn how to program in Python?

Building computer programs regularly is the best way to learn Python. One type of computer program that we could build would be a video game. Video games can be complex to build and contain a lot of instructions. With Python, there is something for every gamer. We will be getting help with this by making use of <b>modules</b>.

A <b>module</b> is a <b>bundle of code that can make it easier for us to complete common tasks</b>. We will be importing modules into the programs we write. Here is a list of modules we might find helpful as we go through the course.

- Pygame
- Pygame Zero
- Math
- Random
- Time
- Tkinter

Which module did we `import` in the following code snippet?

```
import pgzrun

def draw():
    screen.draw.text("Hello", topleft=(10,10))

pgzrun.go()
```
